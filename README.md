# Preparation of 3D Data for HSR-Game with Motion
In this project different methods of creating a 3D model of an area with several buildings were evaluated. Aim was to create a realistic environment for a game. The workflow of the different methods should be transferable, meaning that other users can easily adapt the workflow and use it for their area. The evaluation was focused on two main approaches: The first is using purely open data and open source software, such as OSM and OSM2World. The other approach uses commercial photogrammetry software with and without the help of a drone.

As expected using photogrammetry creates a much more realistic model than building one out of OSM data. On the other hand it can cost around 5000 CHF if you have to buy the involved software and tools (camera/drone). We assume that some universities may already have these tools and software in-house. Either way it takes a considerate amount of time to create a realistic 3D model of buildings. But in the end both methods archive a usable 3D model. Depending on how much time, available tools and preferred approach one or the other method will be more suitable.
